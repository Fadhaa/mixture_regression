# ðŸ“Š Mixture Regression

A lightweight Python package for fitting **finite mixture models of linear regression** using the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm â€” built entirely from scratch.

This is useful for modeling data with latent subpopulations, such as in clinical electronic health records (EHR), stratified outcomes, or hidden classes in regression problems.
